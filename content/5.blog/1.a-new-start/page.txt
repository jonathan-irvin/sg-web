I decided to start my site from scratch using stacey app and I have no idea how long I will keep it like this.  One of the benefits of this site is that it is strictly flat-file based and does not require a MySQL database to run.  I figured I would use this for my photography as well.  I don't really care if people check out my site or not, but I wanted this site to be about me, stuff I'm working on, my thoughts, etc.
