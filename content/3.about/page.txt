title: Little Bit 'Bout Me

I love computers. I grew up with them. When I was in grade school, I programmed batch files on an old HP 486 for fun. Now, I'm a professional web developer and system administrator. I enjoy bringing small businesses into the Internet and giving the small business owner the tools they need to modernize their business and put them on the Information Superhighway.
